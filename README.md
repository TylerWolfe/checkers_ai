# Checkers AI

## Description
This is a checkers game that I am building with the goal of exploring AI, Python, Git, and the software development process. As a beginner in Python, Iâ€™m leveraging AI tools like ChatGPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet to write *every line of code*. The ultimate goal is to develop a functional, polished game while gaining hands-on experience in AI algorithms, game development, and version control.

## Technologies
- **Python**: Primary programming language.  
- **Pygame**: For rendering the game and handling animations.  
- **Minimax Algorithm**: AI decision-making.  
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Optimization for the Minimax algorithm.

## Features

### 1. Main Menu
- Start a new game.  
- Resume a previously saved game.  
- View game statistics (e.g., wins, losses, draws).  
- Adjustable AI difficulty slider.  
- Toggle for forced jumps (optional rule).

### 2. In-Game
- Proper turn-based gameplay mechanics.  
- Smooth move and jump animations.  
- Splash screens for game outcomes (win/lose/draw).  
- Undo move button.  
- Hint system for optimal moves (powered by AI).

### 3. AI
- Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning for efficiency.  
- Hint system uses the same AI logic to suggest the best move.  

### 4. Logging
- Detailed game logs for debugging, analytics, and post-game review.
